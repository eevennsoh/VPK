# sync-merge.sh - Merge orphan branches (no common history) back to main
#
# Usage: sync-merge.sh [branch-name] [options]
#   --dry-run       Preview only, don't make changes
#   --auto-merge    Automatically merge the PR after creation
#   --cleanup       Delete the rebased branch after merge
#
# This script handles branches that have no common commit history with main,
# typically created from fresh VPK boilerplate exports.
